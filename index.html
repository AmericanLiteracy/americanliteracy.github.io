English spelling is incredibly difficult, requiring many years of memorization to become proficient. At the same time, 30 million adults in the US cannot read or write above a third-grade level. The connection is obvious: difficult spelling hinders education and job opportunities.
            </h3><h3 align = "left">
For the past century, efforts at English spelling reform have failed because adults, who have already mastered complex spelling, don’t want to change. But now, the <em>computer</em> revolution provides the opportunity for a <em>literacy</em> revolution: everyone could choose between traditional spelling and a new simplified spelling system, on their own screens.
Since the 1980s, the American Literacy Council has developed a simplified spelling system based on phonetics and rules, and which ‘makes sense’ - it can be read immediately by current English readers.
            </h3><h3 align = "left">
Our complex spelling system is self-imposed, and we, as a society, have the power to change it. Computers provide a tool to transition, without forcing new spelling on anyone. 
Sensible English spelling would greatly benefit future generations of children, as well as foreign speakers the world over. Spelling reform would free up years of valuable class time.
Poor literacy is a huge problem, but noone ever talks about the fundamental cause of the problem, or how to fix it!
            </h3><h3 align = "left">
At the American Literacy Council, we are excited to share our ideas about how to reform English spelling!  Please look at <a href="/ts/soundspel">SoundSpel</a> and see what you think!
